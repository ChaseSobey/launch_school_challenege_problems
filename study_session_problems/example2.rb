Consider the word "abode". We can see that the letter a is in position 1 and b is in position 2. In the alphabet, a and b are also in positions 1 and 2. Notice also that d and e in abode occupy the positions they would occupy in the alphabet, which are positions 4 and 5.

Given an array of words, return an array of the number of letters that occupy their positions in the alphabet for each word. For example,

p symm(["abode","ABc","xyzD"]) == [4, 3, 1]
"abode"
a, b, d, e --> 0134
ABc ---> 012
xyzD ---> 3


p symm(["abide","ABc","xyz"]) == [4, 3, 0]
p symm(["IAMDEFANDJKL","thedefgh","xyzDEFghijabc"]) == [6, 5, 7]
p symm(["encode","abc","xyzD","ABmD"]) == [1, 3, 1, 3]
