Twenty-One is a card game consisting of a dealer and a player. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over

Gameplay Overview:

- Both participants are initially dealt 2 cards from a 52-card deck.
- The player takes the first turn, and can 'hit or 'stay'
- If the player busts, the player loses. If he stays, its the dealers turn
- The dealer must hit until their cards add up to at least 17
- If he busts, the player wins. If both player and dealer stays, then the highest total wins.
- If both totals are equal, then its a tie, and nobody wins.
