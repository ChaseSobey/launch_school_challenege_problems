PS

write a program that will take a string of digits and return all possible consecutive number series
of a specified length in that string

implicit requirements
- returned value must be a nested array of integers
- an ArgumentError is raised if the desired length is longer than the string in question

need a class called Series
need a constructor method that takes a string of numbers as an argument
need an instance method called slices that returns a nested array of all the consecutive number series

Examples / Test Cases

For example, the string "01234" has the following 3-digit series:

012
123
234

Likewise, here are the 4-digit series:

0123
1234
Finally, if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you should throw an error.

Data Structure

A nested array is required for this problem as the returned value
the string needs to be converted into an array of characters and then an array of single digit integers

Algorithm

SPIKE

class Series
  attr_reader :number_string
  def initialize(num)
    @number_string = num
  end
  
  def slices(slice_size)
    raise ArgumentError.new if slice_size > number_string.size
    
    result = []
    character_array = number_string.chars.map(&:to_i)
    #iterate through the character array to get all of the possible number strings
  end
end
