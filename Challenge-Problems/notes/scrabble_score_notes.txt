--- Problem Statement ---

Write a program that given a word computes the Scrabble score for that word

Implicit Requirements
  -points are case INSENSITIVE


--- Examples / Test Cases ---

point totals are as follows

1 point: A,E,I,O,U,L,N,R,S,T
2 point: D,G
3 point: B,C,M,P
4 point: F,H,V,W,Y
5 point: K
8 point: J,X
10 point: Q,Z

--- Data Structure ---

Use a hash and write out each letter as a key and its corresponding point worth as the value

--- Algorithm ---

SPIKE IS AS FOLLOWS

class Scrabble
  LETTER_POINTS = {#...}
  attr_reader :word
  def initialize(word)
    @word = word
  end
  
  def score
    #some form of iteration through each letter in the word and summation of point total
  end
  
  def self.score(scrabble_word)
    #same thing as instance method score
  end
end

ALGORITHM FOR SCORE INSTANCE METHOD
1. INITIALIZE local variable sum = 0
2. word.downcase.chars.each do |letter|
  3. sum += LETTER_POINTS[letter]
  4.END
5. RETURN sum
END

use same structure for class method score
