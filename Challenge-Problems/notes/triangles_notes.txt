--- PROBLEM STATEMENT ---

Write a program that determines if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene

Explicit Requirements
- Equilateral has 3 sides same length
- Isosceles has 2 sides the same length
- Scalene has no sides the same length

To be a triangle, all sides must be > 0 and sum of 2 sides length must be greater than
the length of the third side

--- Examples / Test Cases ---

Given in triangles_test.rb file

we know we need a Triangle class with a constructor method that takes 3 values
as arguments

we know this class has a method called kind, which returns the kind of triangle as a string

we know that fake triangles raise an error during instantiation

--- Data Structure ---

We will use a class
we can store the 3 sides in an array

--- Algorithm ---

1. CREATE a class called Triangle
2. DEFINE an initialize method that takes 3 integers as arguments and assigns them as instance variables
3. DEFINE a method called valid_triangle? which checks if any side is less than 0 and if sum of any 2 sides if less than any 3rd side
  if triangle is determined to be invalid, RAISE ARGUMENT ERROR
4. INCLUDE valid_triangle? method in constructor method

5. DEFINE a method called kind that determines and returns if equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle
  6. method does this by counting the number of occurences of each of the 3 legs
