--- Problem Statement ---

Write a program that determines the anagrams of words

Implicit Requirements
  -must be case insensitive
  -must not consider the same word an anagram (ie corn or CORN is not an anagram for corn)
  -MUST HAVE A CLASS CALLED ANAGRAM
  -MUST HAVE AN INSTANCE METHOD CALLED MATCH THAT DOES THE MATCHING

--- Examples / Test Cases ---

see ../test/anagrams_test.rb for test cases

--- Data Structure ---

result of match instance method should be an array that is either empty or contains all the matches

--- Algorithm ---
need to downcase and sort the word under analysis and compare each possible anagram by downcasing and sorting

SPIKE

class Anagram
  attr_reader :word
  def initialize(word)
    @word = word
  end
  
  def match(potential_anagrams_arr)
    use selection and sorting here
  end
end

ALGORITHM FOR MATCH INSTANCE METHOD

1.  potential_anagrams_arr.select do |word|
  2. next if word.downcase == @word.downcase
  3. word.downcase.sort == @word.downcase.sort
3.END
