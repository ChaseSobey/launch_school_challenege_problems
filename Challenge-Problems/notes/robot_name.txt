PS

Write a program that manages robot names

Explicit Requirements
when a new robot is intantiated, the robot object should be given a random name

need a reset instance method that assigns a new name to the robot

robots CANNOT have the same name

implicit requirements
  -need a name getter and setter method

Examples / Test Cases

See robot_name_test.rb for test cases

Data Structure

a class variable that is an array can be added to each time a robot object is instantiated
when a robot is reset, that particular name can be removed from the array

Algorithm

SPIKE

class Robot
  @@existing_names = []
  attr_accessor :name
  
  def initialize
    #sample 2 random capital letters and then sample 3 random numbers and set equal to name
    @name = name
    
    @@existing_names << @name
  end
  
  def reset
    #remove the current name from @@existing_names
    #do the same stuff for the initialize instance method
  end
end
