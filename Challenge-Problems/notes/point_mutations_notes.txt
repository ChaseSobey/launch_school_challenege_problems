--- Problem Statement ---

Write a program that determines the Hamming Distance between 2 strands of DNA (2 strings)
The Hamming Distance is the number of differences between 2 strings of equal length

Explicit Requirements
  - Only equal length strings can be compared
  -If 2 strings are of unequal length, compare up to the end of the shorter string

--- Examples / Test Cases ---

See point_mutations_test.rb file for test cases

--- Data Structure ---

DNA will be a class with a constructor method that takes 1 string as an argument
  DNA strand will be stored as a string variable
  
DNA class will have a method called hamming_distance(other_string) which takes 1 string as an argument

--- Algorithm ---

1. CREATE a class called DNA
2. DEF Initialize method that assigns a string to an instance variable called genome

3. DEF method called hamming_distance(other_genome) that takes a string as an argument
  4. INITIALIZE a variable called analysis_length = [genome.size, other_genome.size].min
  5. INITIALIZE a variable called hamming_distance_counter = 0
  
  6. genome[0..analysis_length].each_with_index do |point, index|
    7. hamming_distance_counter += 1 IF point == other_genome[index]
  8. END
  9. RETURN hamming_distance_counter
10. END
END
