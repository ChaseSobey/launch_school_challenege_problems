Data Structure

store each capital letter in a constant that is an array 

Algorithm

need a class called diamond
need an instance method called make_diamond(letter) that takes a single letter to denote the size of the diamond

should have a helper method for ascending, middle and descending sections of the diamond

SPIKE

class Diamond
  LETTERS = ('A'..'Z').to_a
  def self.make_diamond(letter)
    diamond_variable = ''
    diamond_variable << ascending_section
    diamond_variable << middle_section
    diamond_variable << descending_section
    
    diamond_variable
  end
  
  def self.all_but_middle_row(letter)
    #make all of the ascending portion of the diamond
  end
  
  def self.middle_row(letter)
    #make the middle row of the diamond
  end
end
